  [PRELIMINARY] This final project write-up investigates the effect of multiple borrowers on mortgage default risk using double machine learning. By using this approach, we can account for complex relationships between variables while producing consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of treatment effects. We find that having multiple borrowers at origination is associated with a lower probability of default of around -1.6 percentage points. This is consistent with the findings of previous research that suggests that multiple borrowers can create a collective risk mitigation mechanism that enhances overall loan repayment probability. This result is robust to different models and control variables.

# Introduction

The landscape of mortgage lending has evolved significantly in recent decades, with multi-borrower arrangements becoming increasingly prevalent in residential real estate financing. These arrangements, typically involving co-borrowers or multiple individuals sharing responsibility for a mortgage, present a complex interplay of financial dynamics that critically impact default risk assessment.

The fundamental premise of multi-borrower mortgages challenges traditional single-borrower models by introducing additional layers of financial complexity. Research by @deng2007 suggests that multiple borrowers can fundamentally alter the risk profile of a mortgage through diversified income streams and shared financial responsibility.

Multiple borrowers typically provide more stable income sources, potentially reducing the likelihood of default. A seminal study by @ghent2011 demonstrated that households with multiple income earners exhibit more resilient mortgage repayment capabilities. The presence of multiple borrowers creates a collective risk mitigation mechanism. According to research by @lusardi2011, co-borrowers often develop informal risk-sharing strategies that enhance overall loan repayment probability.

The nature of relationships between co-borrowers significantly impacts default risk. Research by @mian2009 highlighted that familial or close personal relationships among co-borrowers can create additional psychological incentives for loan repayment.

This research document aims to estimate the causal effect of multiple borrowers on mortgage default risk using double machine learning methods. We leverage a comprehensive dataset of mortgage loans Our analysis focuses on identifying whether and to what extent having multiple borrowers affects the probability of mortgage default.

The use of double machine learning allows us to control for a rich set of covariates while maintaining valid statistical inference. This methodology, developed by @chernozhukova, combines the flexibility of machine learning with the rigorous causal inference framework of econometrics. By using this approach, we can account for complex relationships between borrower characteristics, loan features, and economic conditions that might influence both the decision to have multiple borrowers and the likelihood of default.

Our findings contribute in principle to practical policy discussions on a simple to understand topic: the effect of multiple borrowers on mortgage default risk. Understanding how multiple borrowers affect default risk can inform lending practices, risk assessment models, and regulatory policies in the mortgage market. Additionally, our methodological approach demonstrates the value of modern machine learning techniques in addressing traditional economic questions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data and key variables. Section 3 outlines our empirical methodology, including the double machine learning framework and identification strategy. Section 4 presents our main results and robustness checks. Finally, Section 5 concludes with policy implications and directions for future research.

# Data

Our analysis uses data from Freddie Mac's Single-Family Loan Performance dataset, which provides detailed information on mortgage loans acquired by Freddie Mac from 2000 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset includes both loan-level characteristics at origination and monthly performance data, making it ideal for studying mortgage default patterns over time.

For computational reasons, we focus on the mortgages loans originated between 2011 and 2016 for all loans originated in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) which had information for the rate of unemployment and authorization permits for these years. This dataset contains approximately 900,000 unique mortgage loans, with each loan tracked monthly from acquisition until it is either paid off, enters default, or is still active at the end of our observation period. For each loan, we observe a rich set of characteristics including:

: Table: Variables in the dataset

We clean our dataset of any missing value in these variables. To ensure consistency in our analysis, we focus on conventional, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages originated between 2010 and 2024, allowing us to observe post-origination performance for at least three years for all loans in our sample.

For our main analysis, we define default as a loan becoming 90 or more days delinquent, which is a standard definition in the mortgage literature. We construct our treatment variable based on whether a loan has multiple borrowers at origination, and we create a rich set of control variables including borrower characteristics, loan features, and local economic conditions.

## Identification strategy

To identify a causal effect of multiple borrowers on mortgage default risk, we create an identifying variable in the form of a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the loan has multiple borrowers at origination and 0 otherwise. This coupled with a rich set of control variables helps us isolate the causal effect of multiple borrowers from other confounding factors that might influence both the decision to have multiple borrowers and default risk.

The default variable is defined as a loan becoming 90 or more days delinquent, which is a standard definition in the mortgage literature, and it is observed for all loans in our sample for the whole period of each loan's observation window.

# Methodology

## Double machine learning

Our empirical strategy employs a double machine learning (DML) approach to estimate the causal effect of multiple borrowers on mortgage default risk. This methodology, introduced by @chernozhukova, allows us to handle high-dimensional controls while maintaining valid statistical inference. The key advantage of DML is that it can accommodate complex relationships between variables while producing consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of treatment effects.

The DML framework proceeds in three main steps:

1.  First Stage: We estimate the relationship between our treatment variable (multiple borrowers) and control variables using multiple machine learning methods. This produces residualized treatment values that are orthogonal to the control variables.

2.  Second Stage: We estimate the relationship between our outcome variable (default) and control variables, again using multiple machine learning methods. This produces residualized outcome values.

3.  Final Stage: We regress the residualized outcome on the residualized treatment to obtain our treatment effect estimate.

To implement this approach, we use a combination of methods including Random Forests, Boosted Trees and Neural Networks. We employ cross-fitting to avoid overfitting concerns, splitting our data into K folds and ensuring that the sample used for prediction is separate from the sample used for estimation.

Our main specification can be represented as the following the partially linear model:

$$
default_{i}=\beta D_{i}+g(Z_{i})+\epsilon_{j, t}
$$

Where $D_{i}$ is the treatment indicator for multiple borrowers, $Z_{i}$ is our vector of control variables (both at the borrower, loan and MSA level) and $\epsilon_{j, t}$ is the error term.

We implement sample splitting using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness of our results. For inference, we use clustered standard errors at the state level to account for potential spatial correlation in default patterns and fixed effects to control for different vintages of loans (origination month and year).

# Results and further research

From analysis of the data, we find that having multiple borrowers at origination is associated with a lower probability of default. This is consistent with the findings of previous research that suggests that multiple borrowers can create a collective risk mitigation mechanism that enhances overall loan repayment probability.

: Effect of Multiple Borrowers on Default Risk Across Different Models {#tbl-results}

The following figures visualize our main results. Figure 1 shows the coefficient estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals across different models, while also comparing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for both the outcome (Y) and treatment (D) predictions.

![Coefficient estimates and confidence intervals across different models](estimates_plot.png)

![RMSE comparison for outcome and treatment predictions across models](model_comparison_plots.png)

As we can observe from the figures, all models consistently estimate a negative effect of multiple borrowers on default risk, with the magnitude ranging from approximately -1.8 to -1.6 percentage points. The confidence intervals are relatively tight and do not cross zero, indicating statistical significance across all specifications. The RMSE values show that our models achieve similar prediction accuracy, with slightly better performance in predicting the outcome variable compared to the treatment variable.

## Further research

One interesting extension of this research would be to estimate the effect of multiple borrowers on default risk using a difference-in-differences approach. This would allow us to isolate the causal effect of multiple borrowers from other confounding factors that might influence both the decision to have multiple borrowers and default risk.

Given the long series of data, we could also estimate the effect of multiple borrowers on default risk using a panel data approach. This would allow us to control for unobserved heterogeneity and time-invariant factors that might influence both the decision to have multiple borrowers and default risk. There has been some regulation work on the Freddie Mac loan origination process which has removed the requirement to distinguish between single and multiple borrower mortgages. This would allow us to estimate the effect of multiple borrowers on default risk using a difference-in-differences approach accounting for this change in regulation, but the data is not available for this analysis and would be needed to be analyzed in the upcoming years as the mortgages start maturing.
