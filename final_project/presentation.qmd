# Introduction

-   Mortgages are a key component of the US housing market and a major source of household wealth.
-   The ability to predict mortgage defaults is crucial for risk management in the financial industry.
-   This project aims to use debiased machine learning methods to estimate causal effects of borrower characteristics on mortgage performance.
-   We will focus on the effect of the number of borrowers on the probability of default.

# Motivation

-   Importance of a healthy housing market for economic growth.

    -   Housing wealth accounts for 34% of the net worth of the median household.
    -   The effect of a housing downturn on household wealth is equivalent to losing 10% of GDP.

-   Literature on the effect of borrower characteristics on mortgage performance is mixed.

-   We do not aim to predict default, but to estimate the effect of borrower characteristics on the probability of default

-   Mortgages are an unique type of loan as they are secured by real estate and the possibility of foreclosure is a concern for both lenders and borrowers. 

# Data Processing

-   Source: Freddie Mac Single-Family dataset

-   Information from 2011 to 2016 on 96M loans

-   Chose to work with a sample of 306K loans (from IL) to speed up computation

-   Information on origination and performance. Around 100 variables available for each loan. Choice of covariates focused on borrower and loan characteristics.

# Characteristics of the processed data

-   Origination characteristics:
    -   **Number of borrowers**
    -   Loan purpose
    -   Property type
    -   Occupancy type
    -   Score
    -   Loan amount
    -   Loan term
    -   Origination date
-   Performance:
    -   Monthly payment history
    -   Current delinquency status
    -   **Default status**

- Really high quality data which is not only updates new information but also checks for errors in past publications.

# Methodology

-   Usage of DML to estimate the effect of borrower characteristics on the probability of default.
-   Default follows a logistic process.
-   Follows proposed methdology by Chernozhukov, Hansen, et al for DML:
    -   Modifications: included cluster-robust standard errors at the MSA level and fixed-effects to control for different vintages of loans.


We perform inference on $\beta$ in the following the partially linear model: $$
default_{i}=\beta D_{i}+g(Z_{i})+\epsilon_{j, t}. $$

---

In the first stage, using cross-fitting, we employ modern regression methods to build estimators $\hat \ell(Z_{i})$ and $\hat m(Z_{i})$, where

-   $\ell(Z_{i}):=E(Y_{i}|Z_{i})$

-   $m(Z_{i}):=E(D_{i}|Z_{i})$

Using these, we obtain the estimates of the residualized quantities 

-   $\tilde Y_{i} = Y_{i}- E(Y_{i}|Z_{i})$ 
-   $\tilde D_{i}= D_{i}- E(D_{i}|Z_{i})$

Using these residualized quantities, we note our model can be written as 

$$ \tilde Y_{i} = \beta \tilde D_{i} + \epsilon_{i}, \quad E (\epsilon_{i} |\tilde D_{i}) =0.$$ 

In the final stage, using ordinary least squares of $\tilde Y_{i}$ on $\tilde D_{i}$, we obtain the estimate of $\beta$. We also add cluster-robust standard errors at the MSA level and fixed-effects to control for different vintages of loans.

# Main Results

| Model | Estimate | Std. Error |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Basic Regression | -0.0211 | 0.0056 |
| Controls | -0.0194 | 0.0047 |
| DML No Controls | -0.0212 | 0.0056 |
| DML Basic Controls | -0.0197 | 0.0046 |
| DML RF | -0.0187 | 0.0048 |
| DML Boosted Trees | -0.0192 | 0.0049 |
| DML NN (Early Stopping) | -0.0193 | 0.0050 |

Note: All coefficients are significant at the 5% level.
Standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.
RMSE Y and RMSE D show the prediction accuracy of the first-stage models.

The results show that:

- Having more than one borrower consistently reduces default probability by about 1.9-2.1 percentage points
- The effect is robust across different ML specifications in the first stage
- All estimates are precisely estimated and statistically significant

# Conclusions

-   Showed the importance of methods such as DML to estimate causal effects of borrower characteristics on mortgage performance in a context of high-dimensional data and nonlinearities.
-   The results suggest that the number of borrowers has a positive effect on the probability of default, but this effect is reduced once we control for borrower characteristics and non-linearities.
-   The results are robust to the inclusion of different controls and model specifications on the positive effect of the number of borrowers on the probability of default.

# Further work

-   Include more variables in the analysis:
    -   Actually publicly available variables: economic variables, demographics, etc.
    -   Variables not publicly available: loan-level variables, debtor characteristics, etc.
-   Only worked with a sample of the data: from 96M observations, only worked with 306K.
-   Include more heterogeneity in the analysis:
    -   Different sub-samples of the data.
    -   Data from recent years has a modified number of borrowers variable which goes up to 10 borrowers
-   Include different definition of default: used the most conservative one to analyze the effect but in terms of predicting defaults, this might not be the best definition.
